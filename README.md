# data_reduction_scrap
## mostly for questions while working on reduction pipeline
# data_reduction_middle
## it works for ds so far so wanted to save, but this is a work in progress still
# data_reduction_BETTERmiddle
## this isnt a final version but definitely a cleaned up version of my work, completes reduction for one target, only 
## step missing is flux calibration and eventually will be re-doing functions used here but for now this method works
